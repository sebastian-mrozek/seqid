Introduction
---
Seqid is a service for providing unique strings that are part of a sequence.
Many systems use sequences for things like: order numbers, customer numbers, invoice numbers.
This project was born out of a need for managing unique numbers for an e2e test environment.
Imagine the following scenario: the test framework is running tests in parallel and needs to emulate an external system sending data to the target system with a unique sequence number in a specific format.
The numbers have to be unique across all test executions, and a few formats are required, depending on the test scenario flavour. 

Each sequence is defined by name and namespace and consists of:
- starting number
- prefix
- suffix
- padding

Examples of a formatted sequence with a name @ namespace:
- orders @ online: `O0001234-ON`
- orders @ store: `O001011-S`
- invoices @ any: `INV007313`
- some @ sequence: `8`

The service allows CRUD operations to define, list, delete and reset a sequence as well as incrementing the number and retrieving last value.
Project provides a java service and a rest application. A docker image is published and usage examples are provided in `docker-compose` folder. 
The rest application also serves a front-end with a UI allowing viewing and management of sequences.

The project is also an example of how you can build a fast web application quickly with minimal dependencies.

WARNING:
The service is working well and have good test coverage but there is a few features missing, see TODO list at the end of this file.

Tech stack
---
- Java 11
- Jackson for everything JSON
- eBean for persistence and migrations
- Javalin and avaje/http for easy REST endpoints
- Svelte for front-end

Running the service
---
The service can be run using docker:
```
docker run --publish 7000:7000 softwaremrozek/seqid
```
The folder `docker-compose` contains 2 files with examples of docker configuration:
1. Service using an embedded h2 database with a local `db` folder bound to the db folder inside docker container where h2 database files will be stored.
   ```
   docker compose -f embedded-h2.yml up
   ```
2. Service using an external postgres with password defined in an environment variable `DB_PASS` (below supplied via `.env.local` file, not committed)
   ```
   docker compose -f external-postgres.yml --env-file .env.local up
   ```

If you prefer to embed the service in your application, just use the java service (`service` project) and configure the db (see examples of configuration in the `application.yaml` in `main` and `test` resources in the `web-service` project).

Sample curl commands
---
Create new sequence:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"namespace":"test1","name":"order-numbers","start":123,"length": 10,"prefix":"INV-",suffix":"-ON"}' http://localhost:7000/sequence
```

List sequences:
```
curl http://localhost:7000/sequence
curl http://localhost:7000/sequence?namespace={namespace}
```

Get sequence:
```
curl http://localhost:7000/sequence/{id}
```

Get next value from sequence:
```
curl http://localhost:7000/sequence/{id}/next
```

Reset sequence to default start:
```
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:7000/sequence/{id}
```

Reset sequence to custom start (10):
```
curl -X PATCH -d '{"start":10}' http://localhost:7000/sequence/{id}
```

Delete sequence:
```
curl -X DEL http://localhost:7000/sequence/{id}
```

TODO
---
- BUG: prevent padding length that would exceed max number allowed in a sequence
- BUG: decide what to do when sequence reaches max (document what max is for each db platform)
- DOC: provide description for docker image
- DEV: versioning of docker images and the app itself, API?
- DEV: generate java client from API and REST annotations
- BUG: newly created sequence not showing as 'not-initialized' when using postgres.
- UI: Complete error handling (error codes from the server?)
- UI: Add confirmation dialog for deleting and resetting
- UI: searching / filtering by namespace
- UI: layout on small screens
- UX: allow sequence's name and namespace rename using PATCH
- DEV: refactor persistence to store JSON objects rather than relational data 
- OPS: graalvm - generate native image
- OPS: host in the cloud

Optional:
- OPS: provide GraphQL API
